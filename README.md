# RedditScreenCap

## A smol bot to automatically take a screenshot of a comment and post it somewhere!

This was really just an excuse for me to learn some python by whatever...

### How to use!

Make a new comment under a post or comment then type...

!ScreenCap (defined in config.py -> TriggerKeyword)
- theme (currently there is: light, dark) (defined in config.py -> Themes)
